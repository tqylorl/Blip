Blip is a custom programming language I designed and implemented as a technical project to explore the fundamentals of language parsing, interpretation, and execution. The language supports basic operations such as variable declarations, arithmetic and logical computations, and output commands.

Key Features:
Parser: Converts Blip code into a structured format for interpretation.
Symbol Table: Efficient management of variables using a hash table.
Execution Engine: Interprets and executes Blip code, handling complex expressions with proper operator precedence.
Memory Management: Ensures efficient allocation and deallocation during program execution.
Version Control & Testing: Extensive testing and version control practices were employed to ensure reliability and maintainability.

Technologies Used: C/C++, Hash Tables, Recursive Descent Parsing, Custom Memory Management
